# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: After a lot of building and rebuilding a Gatsby site, I've finally gotten the page scaffolding to work and I have a good grasp on what is happening and how it all fits together. 

**Thoughts:** I followed many tutorials to get this to work. I am new to React so it's a bit daunting to build something with it in a way that isn't as familiar as the "create-react-app"'s structure. 

**To Do**: Start adding projects.
           Styles with styled components.
